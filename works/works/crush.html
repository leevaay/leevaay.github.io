  <h2>Crush</h2>
  <p>
When I say I have a crush
It's not a strong feeling
I steal glances when I can
I would say yes if they asked
But would I do anything just so they notice me?
Probably not, unless fate were kind and gave me a chance
So I could talk to them and show them that I'm worthy
Worthy of their gaze and thoughts
